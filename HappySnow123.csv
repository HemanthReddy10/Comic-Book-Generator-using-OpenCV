Once upon a time  there lived a poor child called “Snow”.
He dreamed a lot so that he can never experience the discrimination of poorness.
He worked very hard.
He founded a startup.
He created innovative solutions to the problem
That startup became a success 
 he became one of the richest men in the city.
He became very happy and proud.
He is completely satisfied
After some days he got a doubt 
Doubt is about his total property value.
He called his personal accountant and asked him to evaluate his entire property value.
"""\His PA said Your total properties value will be more than \n sufficient for your next seven generations"""
He got excited after knowing his property value 
After some time- he got a very silly doubt.
He said to himself-” How the 8th generation will survive without my money!”
He became very sad after getting that thought
He started feeling stressed and depressed.
He is getting very bad ideas
He was deprived of sleep as well 
His friends suggested snow to contact the psychiatrist
After a lot of hesitation- He went to a psychiatrist
Snow explained everything to him.
The psychiatrist got baffled after listening to his tricky as well as silly problem
He asked snow to come again tomorrow
Snow got angry as he waited too long to come again tomorrow
He went to the doctor again and waited for his treatment
The doctor simply said like this
Go to the Homeless guy sleeping behind the shop at 9:00 AM tomorrow 
Give him the lunch for that day only
Snow got angry once again
Because of the doctor’s silly treatment
Anyway snow needs to follow his treatment
Next day  Snow takes 3 weeks of food and groceries and went to the homeless guy at 5:00 PM
At that time  Homeless guy is peacefully sleeping with a calm face
Snow gave that food to the homeless guy
He didn’t take that food and asked him to “Go away”
Snow got irritated and asked him patiently to take that food 
He again didn’t take that food
Go away!
Snow got puzzled  by his reply '          
Finally out of anxiety snow said ” why are you not taking this food? It will help you for the next few weeks”
Homeless man replied ” I am completely happy today because I ate my lunch and I don’t know whether I will live tomorrow or not ”
After listening to the words of a beggar Snow realized the importance of self-satisfaction.
Snow said  “Even being the richest person in the city  I am feeling tensed about my 8th generation  and Even  he doesn’t have food for tomorrow but he is sleeping peacefully”
That thought really struck the snows mind
On that day after realizing what he had lost all these days
He went to the doctor and said ” Thank you doctor I finally found out the essence of self-satisfaction”
“Life is very short and we need to be happy with what we have ”
“You have changed my life ”
After realizing everything  he made a very good profit'
“if we think of problem as an opportunity it will help you achieve your dreams”
he started being satisfied with his achievements
Snow also established a “Snowland university” which provides free education to the poor people
